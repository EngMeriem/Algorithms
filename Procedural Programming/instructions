Objective
-----------------------

At this checkpoint, you are demanded to write an algorithm that fulfill the following: 

    Name: Dot product
    Description:

    1-Write a procedure, called dot_product which calculates in the variable ps, the dot(scalar) product of v1 and v2 (v1 and v2 are vectors of IR)
    2-Write an algorithm which determines, for n pairs of given vectors, whether two vectors of given IR are orthogonal, by calling the procedure defined in the previous question. The dot product of two orthogonal vectors is zero.
    3-Modify the previous algorithm if you use a dot_product function instead of a procedure.

Instructions
------------------------

While creating your algorithm, you should: 

    -Use array for presenting the vector.
    -Use nested loop (a loop inside another)
    -Use different types of passing parameters
